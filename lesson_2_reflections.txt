What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It turns your directory into a .git directory. This is how git starts tracking your files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a set of files I have chosen to be commited. The wokring directory is ALL of my files in that current dir. The repository is the entire git repo, you may be in a dir inside the repo.
